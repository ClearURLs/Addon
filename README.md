**ClearURLs** is an add-on based on the new WebExtensions technology and is optimized for *Firefox* and *Chrome* based browsers.

This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browse through the Internet, 
which is regularly updated by us and can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/raw/master/data/data.min.json).

## Application
Many websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. `https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale`) to mark your online activity. 
All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.

Another common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: 
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011
```

Indeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:
`https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct`

## Features

### Translate ClearURLs
You want to help translating ClearURLs into many languages? – Nice

You can choose between two options to contribute. You can create a merge request, or you can use the POEditor to translate ClearURLs.

*Hint: The description field in the translation files are only an information for what the translation is used. 
It is not necessary to translate the description field; in the most cases it is empty.*

#### Merge request
If you want to create a merge request, you must open the path [`_locales/en/messages.json`](https://github.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/blob/master/_locales/en/messages.json) in the ClearURLs repo 
and translate the english terms into terms of your language. Once you have translated all the terms, you make a pull request of your translation. 
Please push your translation into the folder `_locales/{country code}/messages.json`.
